DAND Project 7

## Summary

## Design

## Feedback
After prototyping my visualization, I shared it with 3 people for their feedback. I have implemented the
feedback, and compiled it in this section.
### Software Developer #1
- Too much margin on the top
- Graph should be centered
- Can tell what's being described, but graph needs more description
### Software Developer #2
- It would be nice to see the number of passengers in each group
### Student
- Add another dimension for passenger class
